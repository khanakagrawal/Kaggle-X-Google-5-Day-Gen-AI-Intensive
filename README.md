# Kaggle-X-Google-5-Day-Gen-AI-Intensive
My work through the 5 Day Generative AI Intensive course created by Google Gemini and Kaggle.

Day 1: Understanding how AI works at the architecture and fundamental level (transformers, attention, etc). Also prompt engineering, everything from sampling controls to prompting techniques (system, contextual, role, reAct, chain of thought, one-shot, etc). Lastly, we also covered evaluating models based on output, and using the model itself to do so.
