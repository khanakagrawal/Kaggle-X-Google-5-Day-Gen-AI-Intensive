# Kaggle-X-Google-5-Day-Gen-AI-Intensive
My work through the 5 Day Generative AI Intensive course created by Google Gemini and Kaggle.

Day 1: Understanding how AI works at the architecture and fundamental level (transformers, attention, etc). Also prompt engineering, everything from sampling controls to prompting techniques (system, contextual, role, reAct, chain of thought, one-shot, etc). Lastly, we also covered evaluating models based on output, and using the model itself to do so. 

Day 2: We focused on embedding models, everything from text to image to document to data to joint embeddings and evolution of these models over the years. We also talked about vector databases and vector searches and their use in AI models that are all about relations. Finally, we learned about models like Retrieval Augemented Generation.

Day 3: Focused entirely on Agents, like the orchestration layer, agents vs. models, tools likes functions and data stores and other APIs, etc. Also used LangGraph to build an AI Agent. 

Day 4: We learned about how AI can be used and catered for specific domains. We talked about how it could be used in Cybersecurity or Healthcare, both of which are very sensitive and highly specialized fields. AI can be used in these fields to optimize but with much caution and only after testing it extensively. We worked on tuning models for a specific use case and also using grounding to allow AI to pull from recent information that it may not have been trained on.
